<H1>Sony D30 Camera - Web Interface</H1>
This web interface allows you to remotely control the Sony D30 camera attached
to the server. There are several different interfaces available:
<ul>
<li><a href="info/info.php">Informational interface</a> 
This interface does not allow you to change any settings on the camera. It only
displays all available information.
<li><a href="remote/remoteframes.html">IR Remote Control simulation</a>
This interface looks like the remote control of the camera. You can control
everything that the original remote control can.
<li><a href="remote/sceneframes.html">Select PTZ by scene image</a>
Click on the image you want to see.
<li><a href="list/listframes.html">List interface</a>
This interface consists of a list of all the commands the low level library 
supports. You can do anything the camera is capable of.
</ul>
