 * Current checks performed:
 * - timeout check (checks whether the user has forgotten to stop recording, and publish the recording if they did)
 * - recovery check (checks whether QuickTime has crashed, and restart it if it hs)

 * Timeout check:

 * After that, we check that there has been activity at least once every "timeout" seconds (typically 15 min).
