How the recoder behaves  and holds its states:

state files description
location: /Library/ezcast_recorder/var
file usage:
_current_user       contains the login of the person working this works as a lock to prevent/warn others from interfering
_last_request       last time we received a request from the user's browser (not currently set nor used)
status              state of the recorder (can be "","open","recording","paused","stopped")
var/metadata.xml    user choices for the recording (course,title,desc,type)

When login:

-check if a lock  is present (from _current_user)
 -yes
  -check if recording in advanced state (recording paused or stopped)
   -yes
     -check if recording belongs to user
       -yes
        continue the current recording
       -no
        ask to save and send (private folder ) of other recording according to metadata.xml file
   -no
     not advanced state so do as if no record had begun, show choice form
 -no(not already running)
  show normal choice form
