/**
 *  This CLI script performs various monitoring tasks. It is started when the user starts a recording, and stopped when they stop recording.
 * This script is called by qtbstart and qtbstop.
 * Current checks performed:
 * - timeout check (checks whether the user has forgotten to stop recording, and publish the recording if they did)
 * - recovery check (checks whether QTB has crashed, and restart it if it hs)
 */

/**
 * Timeout check:
 * For the first "threshold" seconds (typically 2 or 3 hours), we decide to trust the user.
 * After that, we check that there has been activity at least once every "timeout" seconds (typically 15 min).
 * This program is meant to be run as a crontask at least once every "timeout" seconds
